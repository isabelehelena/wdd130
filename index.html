                <p>Hello! My name is Isabele Helena and I'm from Pernambuco, Brazil. Some of my favorite things are going to the beach and outdoor places where I can be in contact with nature, or having a good conversation around the table with my family and friends. I love learning and trying new things. I recently returned from my mission in São Paulo, Brazil where I also had the opportunity to serve at the São Paulo Visitor Center. I'm currently starting my studies in the area of ​​technology and systems development and I'm currently working with customer service for an online store.</p>
